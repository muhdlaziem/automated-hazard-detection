<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Building a web application to predict the PM2.5 value. The value then is evaluate to determine the quality of air. However, since the project is still at early stage, our model still have so much room for improvements. We also planned to add more functionalities such as sending alert message to notify user.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Description

Countless phenomena such as floods, fires, and air pollution routinely impact ecosystems, economies, and human safety.
Using deep learning, our regressor model is specialize in calculating the air quality in Particulate Matter 2.5 (PM2.5) measurement provided a few other factors which are Relative Humidity (RH), UGRD & VGRD, Height of Planetary Boundary Layer (HPBL), Temperature (TMP) and AOD reading from GOES R.
